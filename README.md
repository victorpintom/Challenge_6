### Problem: Client requests an analysis of statistical data on gross rents and price per square foot in the San Francisco area to determine
### whether it is viable to creat a one-click solution for end-customers to find viable investment opportunities in this property market
### Solution: A program was developed that retrieves data from csv files to produce plots that aid investment analysis and further, the use of geographich location is inserted to further assess viability
### Recommendation: Next stage in the process is suggested to be the creation of an index that compares gross rents with per square foot price data hence indicating the highest potential investment opportunity. This data could be overlaid in a map plot.
